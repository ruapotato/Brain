# Brain (Working Title)

## Concept
A rhythm-action game where a powerful psychic entity—a floating brain—fights back against hordes of manifested nightmares in a dark, foggy void.

## Core Gameplay
The gameplay is built around a powerful rhythm mechanic. The player must time their attacks to the beat of the music to unleash devastating psychic swipes.

* **Rhythmic Combat:** Attacking on-beat creates wide, powerful psychic waves that can clear out multiple enemies. Off-beat attacks are weak and ineffective.
* **The Player:** A floating brain, representing pure consciousness. It's agile and attacks with raw mental force.
* **The Enemies:** A horde of visual nightmares—abstract, creepy creatures that emerge from the fog. These could be skittering mannequin hands, eerie floating eyes, or other unsettling forms.
* **The Goal:** Survive the onslaught by staying in tune with the music and cleansing the mindscape of these nightmarish apparitions.
